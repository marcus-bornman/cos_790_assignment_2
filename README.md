## Overview

This assignment was completed as part of the COS790 (Hyper-Heuristics) Honours module at the University of Pretoria.
The specification for the assignment can be found [here](specification.pdf). In addition, the report compiled for the submission
of the assignment can be found [in the report folder](report/report.pdf), along with the latex source files used to compile the report.

To reproduce the results mentioned in the report, simply run one of the `reproduce.sh` scripts available in the `combo_1_results`, `combo_2_results`
or `combo_3_results` folders, dependent on which combination of genetic algorithm parameters you want to run the tests for.
Note that you will need to have Maven and java version 1.8 or later installed to run the scripts successfully.
