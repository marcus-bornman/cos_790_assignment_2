\section{Experimental Setup}\label{sec:experimental_setup}
As has also been mentioned, all problem instances were extracted from the ITC 2007 examination timetabling benchmark set \cite{mccollum2010setting} (available at \url{www.cs.qub.ac.uk/itc2007/examtrack/exam_track_index_files/outputformat.htm}). From the benchmark set \cite{mccollum2010setting} two early, two late and two hidden problem instances were used to run experiments on. These instances were comprised of \emph{exam\_comp\_set1.exam}, \emph{exam\_comp\_set4.exam}, \emph{exam\_comp\_set6.exam}, \emph{exam\_comp\_set8.exam}, \emph{exam\_comp\_set9.exam} and \emph{exam\_comp\_set12.exam}. A total of 10 test runs were run on each problem instance for both the single and multi-point search approaches.

In addition, the machine used for development and testing purposes was a 2015 15-inch Macbook Pro with a 2.5 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB of memory and 500GB of storage. At the time of experimentation the machine had a battery cycle count of 684. 

Finally, all of the code and data necessary to reproduce the results is available at \url{https://github.com/marcus-bornman/cos_790_assignment_2}.
